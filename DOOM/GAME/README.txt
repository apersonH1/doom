 About
 -----

 FastDoom is a Doom port for DOS, based on PCDoom by @nukeykt. The goal of
 this port is to make it as fast as posible for 386/486 personal computers

 Motivation
 ----------
 
 Vanilla Doom required a powerful machine when it was released in 1993. 
 To run it properly, a 486 was mandatory, with at least 8 MB of RAM and a 
 Vesa Local Bus video card. A machine with those specs in 1993 was
 pretty damn expensive. The game itself run pretty slow on 386 PCs
 even at low detail and small screen size. I started this project in April 
 2020, after suffering the COVID-19 disease, nearly 27 years after release
 of Doom. I was very sick, and after the recovery I decided that somebody 
 had to make Doom run well on all 386 personal computers, and make their 
 owners proud of their machines.

 Minimum requirements
 --------------------
 
 CPU:        386SX at 16 MHz
 RAM:        4 MB (the executable runs even with less RAM, but it's 
             possible to see random crashes due to low RAM)
 Video card: Any ISA 8-bit Hercules, CGA, EGA or VGA video card. For cool
             graphics a fast VGA video card is recommended
 Controls:   Keyboard (mouse recommended)

 Supported WADS
 --------------

 The supported wads are the following:
    * DOOM.WAD -> DOOM Registered (3 episodes)
    * DOOM1.WAD -> DOOM Shareware (1 episode)
    * DOOMU.WAD -> Ultimate DOOM (4 episodes)
    * DOOM2.WAD -> DOOM II
    * PLUTONIA.WAD -> Final DOOM The Plutonia Experiment
    * TNT.WAD -> Final DOOM TNT Evilution 

 All of them must be the 1.9 version to work fine.

 Supported hardware
 ------------------
 
 CPU: Any x86 processor that supports 32 bit i386 instruction set
 Video cards: Hercules, CGA, EGA, VGA, Plantronics ColorPlus
 Sound cards: Sound Blaster, PC Speaker, Disney Sound Source,
              Gravis Ultrasound, Pro Audio Spectrum, COVOX LPT DAC
 Music cards: Sound Blaster (OPL2 and OPL3), Adlib, MIDI, Gravis Ultrasound
              Sound Blaster AWE32

 Executables
 -----------

 * FDOOM.EXE    => FastDoom Mode Y, same as Vanilla Doom. Requires a VGA
                   video card
 * FDOOM13H.EXE => FastDoom Mode 13h, same as Heretic / Hexen. Only supports
                   high detail mode. Smoother with fast machines.
 * FDOOMCGA.EXE => FastDoom 320x200 4 color CGA. Ugly. Very ugly. Requires
                   a fast CPU.
 * FDOOMEGA.EXE => FastDoom 320x200 16 color EGA. Requires a very fast CPU.
                   ISA 8-bit EGA cards are usually very slow, so don't
                   expect this to run well (10 fps)
 * FDOOMBWC.EXE => FastDoom 640x200 monochrome CGA. Requires a fast CPU.
                   Uses ordered dithering 2x2. Internal resolution 320x200.
 * FDOOMHGC.EXE => FastDoom 640x400 monochrome Hercules. Requires a fast
                   CPU. Also uses ordered dithering 2x2. Internal resolution
                   320x200
 * FDOOMT1.EXE  => FastDoom 40x25 16 colors text mode
 * FDOOMT12.EXE => FastDoom 40x25 16 colors text mode (virtual resolution of
                   40x50)
 * FDOOMT25.EXE => FastDoom 80x25 16 colors text mode (virtual resolution of
                   80x50)
 * FDOOMT50.EXE => FastDoom 80x50 16 colors text mode
 * FDOOMT52.EXE => FastDoom 80x50 16 colors text mode (virtual resolution of
                   80x100)
 * FDOOMVBR.EXE => FastDoom for VBE 2.0 cards. Uses real mode (default, and
                   more compatible). If you use UniVBE use this version
 * FDOOMVBP.EXE => FastDoom for VBE 2.0 cards. Uses protected mode
                   extensions. Some video cards crash with this mode, it
                   should be a little bit faster than the real mode version
 * FDOOMVBD.EXE => FastDoom for VBE 2.0 cards with LFB (triple buffered),
		   all rendering is done directly onto the video card, the
		   same way Mode Y does. Faster for systems with slow RAM
		   access.
 * FDOOMV.EXE   => FastDoom Planar 320x350 vertical mode. The base 320x200 
                   image is stretched to 320x350 (wrong aspect ratio)
 * FDOOMV2.EXE  => FastDoom Planar 320x350 vertical mode. The base 320x200 
                   image is centered in the screen, leaving black borders
 * FDOOMPCP.EXE => FastDoom for Plantronics ColorPlus cards. 320x200 and 
                   16 colors!
 * FDOOMCVB.EXE => FastDoom CGA composite mode. 160x200 and 16 colors!
 * FDOOMC16.EXE => FastDoom CGA 160x100 and 16 colors
 * FDOOMV16.EXE => FastDoom VGA 160x200 and 16 colors
 * FDOOME.EXE   => FastDoom EGA 640x200. Requires a very fast CPU and 16-bit
		   ISA video card (at least). Dithering with 16 colors
 * FDSETUP.EXE  => Utility to setup controls and sound cards
